Hackbright Final Project

Goal Mine is a data collection and report generator for Special Education teachers. It allows teachers to create custom data collection pages for each IEP goal, using methods such as tallying (tracking how many times a behavior is observed), true/false (tracking whether a behavior did or did not occur), range (a likert scale of 1-6), narrative (to describe an incident or instance), and stopwatch (to track goals related to time frames). Reports are generated by date range and include number of instances in given date range, frequency of given inputs, and percentages and averages of integer inputs. Teachers can also document important events that may impact student progress as a "marker", which will be displayed with the report if it falls within the date range.
